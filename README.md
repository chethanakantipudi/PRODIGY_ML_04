Hand Gesture Recognition Model
This project is focused on developing a hand gesture recognition model that can accurately identify and classify different hand gestures from image data. This model enables intuitive human-computer interaction and gesture-based control systems.

Dataset
The dataset used for this project is from Kaggle: Leap GestRecog Dataset.
